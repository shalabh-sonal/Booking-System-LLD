## Understanding the Problem:

1. Users should be able to search for restaurants based on various attributes.
2. Restaurant owners should be able to register their restaurants and add time slots for table bookings.
3. Users should be able to book tables at restaurants based on availability.
4. The system should handle concurrency for multiple parallel booking requests.

#### Identifying Entities:
1. Restaurant
2. User
3. Booking
4. Time Slot

#### Designing the APIs:
1. RegisterRestaurant(restaurant_details): Allows a restaurant owner to register their restaurant by providing details such as name, location, cuisine, etc.
2. AddSlots(restaurant_id, slots): Enables restaurant owners to add time slots for table bookings for their registered restaurants.
3. SearchRestaurant(query): Allows users to search for restaurants based on attributes such as name, city, area, cuisine, etc.
4. BookTable(user_id, restaurant_id, slot_id, num_people): Allows users to book a table at a restaurant for a specified number of people during a specific time slot, provided the table and slot are available.

### Design Considerations:
1. Use a database to store restaurant, user, booking, and time slot information.
2. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only restaurant owners can register restaurants and add time slots, while any logged-in user can search and book tables.
3. Use a queue or locking mechanism to handle concurrency for booking requests to prevent double bookings and ensure data consistency.

#### Implementation:

    a. Define database schema for storing restaurant, user, booking, and time slot information.
    b. Implement API endpoints for registering restaurants, adding time slots, searching restaurants, and booking tables.c. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    d. Implement concurrency handling mechanisms using locks or queues.
    e. Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of each API endpoint.
    f. Document the APIs and provide usage examples.

#### Future Considerations:
Keep the library/interfaces generic enough to be extended for hotel booking or other similar systems in the future.
Design the system to be scalable and efficient to handle potential future requirements.

#### Demonstration:
<!--  -->
Create a working code that demonstrates the functionality of the system.
Test the system with various scenarios, including parallel booking requests, to ensure concurrency handling works as expected.
This step-by-step approach will help in designing and implementing a robust system for restaurant searching and table booking, while also considering future scalability and generic usage.
